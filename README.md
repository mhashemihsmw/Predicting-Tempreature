# Predicting-Tempreature

As the climate changes, predicting the weather becomes ever more important for businesses. Since the weather depends on a lot of different factors, we want to run a lot of experiments to determine what the best approach is to predict the weather.

- In this project, we will use London Weather data sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmanuelfwerr/london-weather-data) to try and predict the temperature.
- The focus of this code-along is running machine learning experiments. We will first do some minor exploratory data analysis, and then use `MLflow` to run experiments on what models and what hyperparameters to use.
- This is interesting for those of you that have already trained a machine learning model before and want to see how you can speed up the process of finding the best model.
